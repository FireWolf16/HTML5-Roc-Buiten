            <p>Cold brew also known as cold press is basically a drink which is made by keeping grounded coffee emerged in cold water or water at room temperature for an extended period of time. In this process the coarse coffee beans are soaked in water for prolonged period say about 12 to 13 hours. 
                Then the water is filtered to remove the ground coffee particles with the help of coffee paper filter, French press or felt, fine metal sieve or by using some other advanced machine. The resultant is a coffee concentrate which can be diluted with milk or water and served either hot or cold. Cold brew coffee usually tastes sweeter because of its low acidity content, the reason being that the coffee beans never come in contact with hot water.\

            <br>
            <p>This is made by mixing a single shot of espresso with three parts of steamed milk. Add sugar to your latte to make it taste better.
                 You can even add sponge cake, cookies or some bread pieces to turn your drink into a breakfast.

            <p>Espresso is a type of black coffee that is developed using espresso machines. This machine forces a small amount of steam and water ranging about 86 to 95 degree Celsius through a finely compacted and grounded coffee under immense pressure. The espresso machines where patented around 1901 and it spread slowly throughout the world. Coffee brewed with the help of espresso is usually denser then coffee brewed by other methods. The espresso which has been perfectly brewed will have thick golden brown foam on the drinkâ€™s surface. 
                The quality of the creme can be determined when the sugar floats on it for few seconds prior to sinking. If the creme is good then it will surely float for few seconds. Espresso is known to be the foundation of different types of coffee drinks like latte, cappuccino, etc.
